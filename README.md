# Kirby Knowledge Base

I needed a docs theme for Kirby and this seemed like a good place to start (a little outdated though). I've updated most of it to abide by modern standards.

* Modern Kirby folder structure
* CSS re-write with flexbox and better typography
* Using the built in search rather than the old plugin
* Various small tweaks

## To do

* ~~Check out the treemenu template and improve where possible~~
* ~~Finish the styling~~ + responsive! (I've added basic media queries & the layout uses vw so it scales pretty well by default)
* ~~Check out the code highlighting part/plugin and fix that~~
* ~~Fix the pre/code wrapping~~

All done!
