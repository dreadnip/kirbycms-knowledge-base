# Kirby Knowledge Base

This is a 2017, Kirby 2.3, re-write of the original knowledge base theme by [@christianreber](http://twitter.com/christianreber).

I've only worked on it briefly, but it should have:

* Modern Kirby folder structure
* CSS re-write with flexbox and better typography
* Using the built in search rather than the old plugin
* Improved treemenu code
* responsive (I should really collapse the menu though)
* Code highlighting

Demo hosted live over at http://sanderdlm.be/docs/

To install, simply clone this repo.

If you want to install this theme on an existing Kirby installation, copy these folders:

* /assets
* /site/blueprints
* /site/controllers
* /site/snippets
* /site/templates

Then hard refresh to clear your cache.
